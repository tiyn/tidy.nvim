## Features

- Remove white space at the end of every line on save
- Remove empty lines at the end of the buffer on save

## Requirements

- Neovim >= 0.9.0

It may (should) work on lower versions, but is tested and updated using nightly.

## Installation

Your installation configuration will depend on your plugin manager. Below is the basic installation (using default options) for lazy.nvim.

```lua
{
    "mcauley-penney/tidy.nvim",
    config = true,
}
```

## Configuration

tidy.nvim comes with the following options and their default settings:

```lua
    {
    	filetype_exclude = {}  -- Tidy will not be enabled for any filetype, e.g. "markdown", in this table
    }
```

A more full example configuration for lazy.nvim would be:

```lua
{
    "mcauley-penney/tidy.nvim",
    opts = {
        filetype_exclude = { "markdown", "diff" }
    },
    init = function()
        vim.keymap.set('n', "<leader>te", require("tidy").toggle, {})
    end
}
```

## Usage

tidy.nvim comes with the following functions:

| Lua                        | Description                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `require("tidy").toggle()` | Turn tidy.nvim off for the current buffer a plugin |

## About and Credits

I originally wrote this as a wrapper around a couple of vim regex commands used for formatting files before I began using formatters. These commands are not mine, please see the sources below. Even with real formatters in my setup now, I still like and use this because I like these specific formats to be applied to every buffer and don't want to have a formatting tool installed for them.
